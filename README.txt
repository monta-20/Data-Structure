When to Use Hashtable in Web Applications

⚠️ Nowadays, rarely used → replaced by Dictionary<TKey, TValue> (type-safe, faster, generic).

Might still appear in:

Legacy .NET applications (pre-2.0).

When you don’t know key/value types at compile time (very dynamic data).

Example: storing HTTP headers or session variables dynamically (but today Dictionary is preferred).

👉 In modern web apps, I’d recommend:

Use Dictionary<TKey, TValue> instead of Hashtable.

Only use Hashtable if you’re maintaining old legacy code.
