📌 When to Use a Dictionary in Web Applications?

A Dictionary is best when you need fast lookups by key.
Here are the common use cases 👇

1. Caching Data (Session, In-Memory Storage)

Web apps often cache data in memory for speed.
👉 Instead of hitting the database every time, you use a Dictionary.

Example:

// sessionId → user object
Dictionary<string, User> sessionCache = new();
sessionCache["abc123"] = new User { Name = "Montassar" };


✅ Use case: Storing logged-in user sessions, API responses, or temporary results.

2. Configuration Settings

Many apps have dynamic settings.
👉 A Dictionary can hold configuration options loaded from a database or file.

Example:

Dictionary<string, string> config = new();
config["Theme"] = "Dark";
config["Language"] = "en-US";


✅ Use case: Store key-value settings like site themes, feature flags, or environment variables.

3. Routing

ASP.NET Core has its own routing system, but you could implement a custom one with Dictionary.

Example:

Dictionary<string, string> routes = new()
{
    { "/home", "HomeController" },
    { "/about", "AboutController" }
};


✅ Use case: Simple mapping of URLs → Controllers/Handlers.

4. Localization / Translation

If you build multilingual apps:
👉 Store translations as Dictionary<key, value>.

Example:

Dictionary<string, string> frTranslations = new()
{
    { "hello", "bonjour" },
    { "bye", "au revoir" }
};


✅ Use case: Quick lookup for text translations in UI.

5. Mapping & Lookup Tables

Sometimes you need to quickly map IDs to values.

Example:

Dictionary<int, string> userRoles = new()
{
    { 1, "Admin" },
    { 2, "User" },
    { 3, "Guest" }
};


✅ Use case: Map role IDs to role names, product IDs to product details, etc.

6. Temporary State in Request Processing

During request handling, you might keep metadata about the request.

Example:

Dictionary<string, object> requestData = new();
requestData["UserId"] = 101;
requestData["AuthToken"] = "xyz";

⚡ When NOT to Use Dictionary

❌ If you need to keep order → use List or SortedDictionary.
❌ If you allow duplicate keys → use Lookup<TKey, TValue> or List<KeyValuePair>.
❌ If the dataset is huge and shared → consider database or distributed cache (Redis, Memcached).
