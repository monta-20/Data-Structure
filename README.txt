📌 When to Use a Queue in Web Applications?

Queues are useful whenever you need to process requests, jobs, or messages in order (FIFO).

Here are some real-world use cases 👇

1. Background Task Processing

In ASP.NET Core apps, you don’t want long-running tasks (like sending emails) to block HTTP requests.
👉 Use a Queue to store tasks, and process them later in the background.

Example:

User registers → enqueue a "Send Welcome Email" task.

Background worker dequeues and sends the email.

2. Rate Limiting & Request Throttling

If too many users hit your API at once:

Put incoming requests into a Queue.

Process them in order, at a safe speed.

This prevents server overload.

3. Notifications System

Web app receives many events (new message, friend request, etc.).

Add them to a queue.

Notification service dequeues and sends them to the right user.

4. Chat Applications

In real-time chat:

Messages can be queued before being delivered to the receiver.

Ensures no messages are lost and order is preserved.

5. Job Scheduling

For tasks like:

Generating reports 📊

Database cleanup 🗑️

⚡ In production, you often use distributed queues instead of in-memory Queue<T>:

RabbitMQ 🐇

Azure Service Bus ☁️

Kafka 🚀

Because multiple web servers need to share the same queue safely.
